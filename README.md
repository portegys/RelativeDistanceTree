Abstract:
A technique for creating and searching a tree of patterns
using relative distances is presented. The search is conducted to find patterns
which are nearest neighbors of a given test pattern. The structure
of the tree is such that the search time is proportional to the distance between
the test pattern and its nearest neighbor, since a larger tree, which can be
expected on average to contain closer neighbors, can be searched faster than a
smaller tree.
